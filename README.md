Headline options
================

Change the available headlines h1 through h6 for the Contao CMS.

This extension will allow to change the available headlines types that content elements can use. The settings can be made at the layout.

The feature is useful for SEO purposes, to ensure not too many unintended h1 are added. But also it makes more sense that sidebars do not contain the largest headline.

Note
----
This feature will not prevent users from moving content elements to another column. So a content element with a h1 as headline can still be moved into a column that does not allow the h1.
